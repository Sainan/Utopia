# Cross-compiling Utopia code

## What is cross-compiling?

Cross-compiling is creating a compiled binary on a system that is different from the system that will be able to execute it.

## What is the solution?

Considering that a solution should work, the only solution I see is native-compiling on the target system. However, this is not possible for every person, so I provide a web service for this purpose:
